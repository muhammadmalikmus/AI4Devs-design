# Subtask: Implement job listing page

## Description
Create a responsive and user-friendly job listing page that allows candidates to view, search, and filter job openings. This page should provide an intuitive interface for browsing available positions and include pagination for efficient loading.

## Steps

### a. Design and implement UI for job listing

1. Create a responsive grid layout for job listings
   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for a flexible, mobile-friendly design
   - Ensure consistent spacing and alignment across different screen sizes

2. Design and implement job listing cards
   - Include key information: job title, department, location, and brief description
   - Add a visual indicator for new job postings (e.g., a "New" badge)
   - Implement hover effects for better interactivity

3. Implement a header section
   - Add a page title (e.g., "Current Openings")
   - Include a brief introductory text about the company's job opportunities

4. Create a sidebar for filters (for larger screens)
   - Design collapsible filter sections for mobile views

5. Implement loading states
   - Add skeleton screens or loading spinners for when data is being fetched

6. Handle empty states
   - Design and implement a message for when no jobs match the current filters

7. Implement error handling
   - Design and implement error messages for failed API requests

### b. Implement search and filter functionality

1. Create a search bar component
   - Implement real-time search functionality (e.g., search as you type)
   - Add debounce to prevent excessive API calls

2. Implement filter components
   - Create dropdown or checkbox lists for:
     * Department
     * Location
     * Job Type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Internship)
     * Experience Level
   - Implement multi-select functionality for each filter

3. Create a "Clear all filters" button

4. Implement URL parameter handling
   - Update URL with current search and filter parameters
   - Parse URL parameters on page load to restore previous search/filter state

5. Integrate with backend API
   - Implement API calls that include search and filter parameters
   - Handle loading, error, and success states

### c. Implement pagination for job listings

1. Design and implement pagination controls
   - Create "Previous" and "Next" buttons
   - Add page number indicators

2. Implement infinite scroll as an alternative to traditional pagination
   - Detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page
   - Load the next set of job listings automatically

3. Update the UI to reflect current page status
   - Highlight the current page number
   - Disable "Previous" button on the first page and "Next" button on the last page

4. Integrate pagination with backend API
   - Include pagination parameters in API requests
   - Update the job listing display when new data is fetched

5. Maintain filter and search state across page changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- The job listing page is visually appealing and responsive across different device sizes
- Job listings are displayed in a clear, easy-to-read format
- Search functionality allows users to find jobs by keyword
- Filter options are available and function correctly
- Pagination (or infinite scroll) works smoothly and integrates with the backend API
- The UI updates appropriately during loading, empty, and error states
- URL parameters correctly reflect the current search, filter, and pagination state

## Notes
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Optimize performance, especially when dealing with a large number of job listings
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large datasets
- Discuss design decisions with the UX team to ensure consistency with overall brand guidelines
