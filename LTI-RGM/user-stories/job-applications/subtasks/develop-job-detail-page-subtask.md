# Subtask: Develop job detail page

## Description
Create a comprehensive and engaging job detail page that provides candidates with all necessary information about a specific job opening and allows them to easily apply for the position.

## Steps

### a. Design and implement UI for job details

1. Create a responsive layout for the job detail page
   - Ensure the design is consistent with the job listing page
   - Optimize layout for both desktop and mobile views

2. Implement a header section
   - Display the job title prominently
   - Show key details: department, location, job type, and experience level
   - Add a posting date and application deadline (if applicable)

3. Create a main content area for job description
   - Implement a well-formatted display for:
     * Job summary
     * Responsibilities
     * Requirements
     * Benefits (if provided)
   - Use appropriate HTML semantics (headings, lists, etc.) for better accessibility and SEO

4. Add a company information section
   - Include a brief company description
   - Add company logo (if available)

5. Implement a sidebar (for desktop view)
   - Display key job details for quick reference
   - Show application deadline with a countdown timer (if applicable)
   - List key qualifications or requirements

6. Create a "Share this job" feature
   - Add social media sharing buttons
   - Implement a "Copy link" functionality

7. Add a "Similar jobs" section
   - Display 3-4 related job openings
   - Implement as a horizontally scrollable list on mobile

8. Implement breadcrumb navigation
   - Allow easy navigation back to the job listing page

9. Handle loading states
   - Implement skeleton screens or loading indicators while job data is being fetched

10. Implement error handling
    - Design and implement error messages for failed API requests
    - Add a "Try again" button for reloading the page

### b. Add "Apply Now" button functionality

1. Design and implement a prominent "Apply Now" button
   - Ensure the button is always visible (consider a sticky button on mobile scroll)
   - Implement hover and focus states for better interactivity

2. Create a modal or slide-in panel for the application form
   - Design a smooth transition animation for opening/closing the form

3. Implement form pre-filling
   - If the user is logged in, pre-fill known information (name, email, etc.)

4. Add form validation
   - Implement client-side validation for all form fields
   - Show clear error messages for invalid inputs

5. Implement file upload for resume
   - Allow drag-and-drop functionality
   - Show a preview of the uploaded file
   - Implement file type and size restrictions

6. Add a "Save as Draft" feature
   - Implement local storage saving for form progress
   - Add a "Continue Application" button if a draft is detected

7. Implement form submission
   - Show a loading indicator during submission
   - Handle and display success and error states after submission

8. Add a confirmation step before final submission
   - Show a summary of the application details
   - Allow the user to review and edit before final submission

## Acceptance Criteria
- The job detail page displays all relevant information clearly and is easy to navigate
- The page is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices
- The "Apply Now" button is prominent and easy to access
- The application form functions correctly, including validation and file upload
- Form progress can be saved as a draft and resumed later
- The submission process is smooth and provides clear feedback to the user
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- The page performs well and loads quickly

## Notes
- Ensure that the job detail page is optimized for SEO
- Implement structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) for job postings to improve search engine visibility
- Consider implementing a "Recently Viewed Jobs" feature using local storage
- Discuss with the backend team about caching strategies for job details to improve load times
- Ensure all text is translatable for potential future localization
