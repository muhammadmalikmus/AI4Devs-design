# User Story: Submit Job Applications

## Title
As a candidate, I can submit job applications

## Description
As a job seeker using the company's career portal, I need to be able to view job openings and submit applications for positions I'm interested in, so that I can be considered for employment opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The career portal displays a list of all active job openings.
2. Users can search and filter job openings by criteria such as job title, department, location, and job type.
3. Each job listing shows key information: job title, department, location, and a brief description.
4. Clicking on a job listing opens a detailed view with full job description, requirements, and an "Apply Now" button.
5. Clicking "Apply Now" opens an application form with the following fields:
   - Full Name (required, text)
   - Email (required, email format)
   - Phone Number (required, with format validation)
   - Resume Upload (required, file upload, accept .pdf, .doc, .docx)
   - Cover Letter (optional, text area)
   - LinkedIn Profile URL (optional, URL format)
   - How did you hear about us? (optional, dropdown)
   - Additional Information (optional, text area)
6. The form includes a checkbox for agreeing to the company's privacy policy and terms (required).
7. The system performs client-side validation on all required fields and data formats.
8. If validation fails, the system highlights problematic fields and provides error messages.
9. Users can save their application as a draft to complete later.
10. Upon successful submission, the system:
    - Displays a success message with a unique application ID
    - Sends a confirmation email to the candidate
    - Stores the application in the database
11. Candidates can view the status of their submitted applications.
12. The system prevents duplicate applications for the same job within a 30-day period.
13. The application process is mobile-responsive and works on various devices and browsers.

## Additional Details

- The system should support uploading resumes up to 5MB in size.
- Implement a progress indicator to show completion status of the application form.
- Provide helpful tooltips for form fields to guide candidates.

## UI/UX Considerations

- Use a clean, intuitive design for the job listing and application pages.
- Implement a save and continue later feature for long application forms.

## Technical Considerations

- Use server-side validation in addition to client-side validation for security.
- Implement CSRF protection for the application form.

- Ensure all user data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

- UI tests for form interactions and responsiveness.
