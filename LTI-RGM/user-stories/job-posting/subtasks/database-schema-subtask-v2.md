# Subtask: Set up database schema for job postings

[...previous content remains the same...]

5. Set up triggers
   - Create a trigger to add a new record to `job_posting_revisions` whenever a job posting is updated

6. Implement the schema
   - Write SQL scripts to create the tables, indexes, constraints, and triggers
   - Test the SQL scripts in a development environment
   - Document any specific database configuration requirements

7. Set up initial data and test cases
   - Create SQL scripts for inserting sample data
   - Develop a set of test queries to verify the schema design

8. Update ORM models
   - Update the ORM (e.g., Prisma) models to reflect the new schema
   - Generate and review any ORM-specific files (e.g., Prisma's schema.prisma)

9. Create database setup documentation
   - Document the steps to create the database and apply the schema
   - Include any necessary environment-specific instructions

## Acceptance Criteria
- The database schema is implemented and can store all required job posting information
- Indexes are in place for efficient querying
- Constraints are implemented to ensure data integrity
- The revision history system is in place and functioning correctly
- ORM models are updated and working correctly with the new schema
- Sample data and test queries are available for verification
- Clear documentation is provided for setting up the database schema

## Notes
- Ensure the schema is optimized for read operations, as job listings will be frequently queried
- Consider partitioning the `job_postings` table by status or date if expecting a very large number of postings
- Discuss with the team if any additional fields or tables (e.g., for tagging or categorization) are needed
- Plan for future schema updates and how they will be managed (e.g., future migration strategy)
