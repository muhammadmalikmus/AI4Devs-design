# LTI-JACA

##¬†Conclusions

- **Compiling a great manifest of the project (PRD, Roadmap, Architecture, Design, etc.) is essential to allow us to explore and take advantage of any chatbot.** Due to the limitations of my free Claude account (number of messages and size of conversation), I faced some issues getting results for my last prompts. I had to edit the previous prompt until I reached the maximum number of messages. Then, I decided to test in a different chatbot, ChatGPT, to avoid providing all the prompts I did in the previous exercise to have a similar context. I just provided the link to the PRD created in the last session, and ChatGPT did an excellent job making the Product Backlog; however, I think it could be even better with a better-provided manifest.
  - Reading the Claude documentation, I learned that Claude reads all the conversations every time we provide a new prompt. It's good to know since that guarantees our new prompt will work over the previous context.
  - When I changed to ChatGPT, I got a notification that ChatPGT cannot have context between different windows and is fully customizable. I didn't test it but that will be helpful to have different chats for specific tasks/experts (Design, Architecture, Product, Development, Sells, etc.)
- On the other hand, if we want to take advantage of all the capabilities of a chatbot and we have the opportunity, it is worth spending some bucks to acquire a license for our favorite chatbot after a full test, exploration, and analysis of the capabilities of each available product in the market.

The following prompts were used in the previous conversation for the LTI-ATS-JACA as a context (continue the discussion in the same chat).

### Prompt 1

- Highlights:
  - Prompt completely built by myself.
  - Including 2 special texts from the AI response in previous conversation where it suggested the following steps to build the ATS: `Development Planning` and `Core Feature Development`.
- Results:
  - üëç The AI provided a great result including everything that was asked for (separation - epics, USs, subtasks -, titles, descriptions, estimations, etc.)
  - üëé The AI didn't take in consideration a "natural" roadmap, even when is not considered business critical, the authentication part was included until Epic 5.

```
Let's start with the Development Planning and Core Feature Development, starting with the MVP features for the LTI-ATS-JACA system.

Create a Product Backlog for the "Must Have" features:
- It should be split into Epics that contain a Business Requirement objective to develop.
- Each Epic must be prioritized based on the Business Impact.
- Epics must be estimated using the T-Shirt Size approach from XS to XXXL based on their complexity.
- Each Epic must contain a big-picture description of the feature to build.
- Add any other information that could be relevant to understand the business requirement.

Then, each Epic must contain a set of related User Stories:
- Each user story must be related to their parent Epic.
- Each user story must split a bit-sized Business Requirement to help build the epic objective.
- Each user story must follow a final user point of view.
- Each user story must follow the following template as a good practice:
 - Title: Summary description of the need
 - Description: As a [persona], I want to [intent], so that I can [benefit].
 - Definition of done: a description that will help determine if the objective of the user story is fulfilled.
 - Notes: Add any helpful information that can help you understand and build the needed solution.
- Each user story must be prioritized based on the final-user impact.
- Each story must be sized using the Fibonacci scale.
- Add tags to each user story that helps to understand the business impact and classify them, for example, Hiring Manager, Recruiter, Interviewer, Candidate, Login, Application Process, Screening, etc.
- Add any vital information to understand the final user's point of view, requirements, etc.

Finally, each User Story must contain a set of Subtasks that will adequately define all the technical tasks:
- Each subtask must have a technical perspective.
- Each subtask must follow the following template:
 - Title: Summary technical description of the requirement.
 - Detailed Description: must include all the technical information needed to complete the task and its purpose.
 - Acceptance Criteria: technical list of all the functional and non-functional requirements to be met.
 - Acceptance Tests: Manual tests must be executed to verify the functionality is correct.
- Each task must prioritized using the Eisenhower matrix to determine which tasks are fully needed and 
- Each task must estimated using two different scales:
 - Fibonacci to size the complexity effort.
 - Time to help understand the Product Team and how many days the work could take.
- Add tags to each user story that help to understand and classify which workstream will work on that and which sections of the system will be impacted, for example, Architecture, Backend, Frontend, Database, Cache, Infrastructure, etc.
```

I understand you want a comprehensive Product Backlog for the LTI-ATS-JACA system, focusing on the "Must Have" features. I'll create this backlog with Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks as requested. Due to the length and complexity of this task, I'll provide a detailed structure for one Epic with its associated User Stories and Subtasks, and then outline the remaining Epics.

### Prompt 5

- Highlights:
  - Include all the details and information required.
  - Takes information provided by the AI.
- Results:
  - üëç The Product Backlog contains all the required information.
  - üëé The sprint planning and timelines were omitted, it provided suggestions about how to do it but it didn't include it per se.

```
Let's create a Product Backlog split in epics, user stories and subtasks following the best industry standards, break down the project into manageable sprints and estimate timelines and resources required.

The Product Backlog for the "Must Have" features:
- It should be split into Epics that contain a Business Requirement objective to develop.
- Each Epic must be prioritized based on the Business Impact.
- Epics must be estimated using the T-Shirt Size approach from XS to XXXL based on their complexity.
- Each Epic must contain a big-picture description of the feature to build.
- Add any other information that could be relevant to understand the business requirement.

Then, each Epic must contain a set of related User Stories:
- Each user story must be related to their parent Epic.
- Each user story must split a bit-sized Business Requirement to help build the epic objective.
- Each user story must follow a final user point of view.
- Each user story must follow the following template as a good practice:
 - Title: Summary description of the need
 - Description: As a [persona], I want to [intent], so that I can [benefit].
 - Definition of done: a description that will help determine if the objective of the user story is fulfilled.
 - Notes: Add any helpful information that can help you understand and build the needed solution.
- Each user story must be prioritized based on the final-user impact.
- Each story must be sized using the Fibonacci scale.
- Add tags to each user story that helps to understand the business impact and classify them, for example, Hiring Manager, Recruiter, Interviewer, Candidate, Login, Application Process, Screening, etc.
- Add any vital information to understand the final user's point of view, requirements, etc.

Finally, each User Story must contain a set of Subtasks that will adequately define all the technical tasks:
- Each subtask must have a technical perspective.
- Each subtask must follow the following template:
 - Title: Summary technical description of the requirement.
 - Detailed Description: must include all the technical information needed to complete the task and its purpose.
 - Acceptance Criteria: technical list of all the functional and non-functional requirements to be met.
 - Acceptance Tests: Manual tests must be executed to verify the functionality is correct.
- Each task must prioritized using the Eisenhower matrix to determine which tasks are fully needed and 
- Each task must estimated using two different scales:
 - Fibonacci to size the complexity effort.
 - Time to help understand the Product Team and how many days the work could take.
- Add tags to each user story that help to understand and classify which workstream will work on that and which sections of the system will be impacted, for example, Architecture, Backend, Frontend, Database, Cache, Infrastructure, etc.
```

This sample provides a detailed structure for one Epic in the Product Backlog, including related User Stories and Subtasks. The actual Product Backlog would contain multiple Epics covering all "Must Have" features, each with its own set of User Stories and Subtasks, following this same format and level of detail.

To break down the project into manageable sprints and estimate timelines:

1. Group related User Stories into potential sprints, aiming for a consistent velocity (sum of story points) per sprint.
2. Prioritize sprints based on the priorities of the Epics and User Stories they contain.
3. Estimate sprint duration based on the team's capacity and the total estimated time of the Subtasks in each sprint.
4. Allocate resources (developers, designers, QA) based on the tags and requirements of the Subtasks in each sprint.

Remember that this is an iterative process, and the backlog should be regularly refined and reprioritized based on feedback and changing business needs.
