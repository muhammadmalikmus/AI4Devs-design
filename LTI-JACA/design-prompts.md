```

Description of the ERD:

1. User: Represents system users (recruiters, hiring managers, admins).
2. JobRequisition: Stores information about job openings.
3. Candidate: Contains details of job applicants.
4. Application: Represents a candidate's application for a specific job.
5. Interview: Stores interview details for applications.
6. ScreeningQuestion: Contains screening questions associated with job requisitions.
7. Communication: Tracks all communications with candidates.
8. Report: Stores generated reports.
9. EEOData: Contains Equal Employment Opportunity data for candidates.

Key relationships:
- Users create JobRequisitions and manage Candidates.
- JobRequisitions receive multiple Applications.
- Candidates submit multiple Applications.
- Applications can lead to multiple Interviews.
- ScreeningQuestions belong to JobRequisitions.
- EEOData belongs to Candidates.

This ERD covers the core entities required for the "Must Have" features of LTI-ATS-JACA. It provides a foundation for database design, showing the main tables and their relationships. The diagram includes primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) to illustrate table connections.

Note that in a full implementation, you might need additional tables or fields, and some relationships might be more complex (e.g., many-to-many relationships might require junction tables). Also, consider adding indexes on frequently queried fields for performance optimization.

```
Following the industry best practices, select the tech stack that best fits the LTI-ATS-JACA product/system, and design the system architecture, creating a system architecture diagram using Mermaid and its description.
```

Certainly! I'll select a tech stack that best fits LTI-ATS-JACA based on industry best practices and design a system architecture accordingly. Then, I'll create a system architecture diagram using Mermaid and provide a description.

Tech Stack Selection:

1. Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
2. Backend: Node.js with Express.js
3. Database: PostgreSQL
4. Caching: Redis
5. Search Engine: Elasticsearch
6. Message Queue: RabbitMQ
7. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
8. CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD
9. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
10. Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
11. API Gateway: Kong
12. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
13. Cloud Provider: AWS

This tech stack is chosen for its scalability, performance, and robust ecosystem support.

Now, let's create a system architecture diagram using Mermaid:

```mermaid

```

System Architecture Description:

1. Client Layer: Users interact with the system through web browsers or mobile apps. The frontend is built with React.js and TypeScript for a responsive and type-safe user interface.

2. Content Delivery Network (CDN): AWS CloudFront is used to serve static assets globally, reducing latency for users.

3. Load Balancer: AWS Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application servers.

4. API Gateway: Kong serves as the API gateway, handling routing, rate limiting, and API versioning.

5. Web Server: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and handles SSL termination.

6. Application Servers: Node.js with Express.js powers the backend, running in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes for scalability and easy management.

7. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JWT is used for secure authentication and authorization.

8. Message Queue: RabbitMQ handles asynchronous tasks and ensures system resilience.

9. Caching: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, improving performance.

10. Search Engine: Elasticsearch provides fast and efficient full-text search capabilities.

11. Databases: PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database for structured data storage.

12. Storage: AWS S3 is used for storing files such as resumes and other documents.

13. Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus and Grafana are used for real-time monitoring and visualization of system metrics. The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for centralized logging and log analysis.

14. CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD is used for continuous integration and deployment, automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

15. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

This architecture is designed to be scalable, resilient, and maintainable. It leverages cloud services (AWS) for infrastructure, uses containers for consistency across environments, and implements modern DevOps practices for efficient development and operations.

The system is built with microservices architecture in mind, allowing for independent scaling and development of different components. The use of message queues and caching helps in handling high loads and improving response times. The inclusion of monitoring and logging systems ensures that the operations team can quickly identify and resolve any issues that arise.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for LTI-ATS-JACA, allowing it to handle the complexities of a modern ATS while providing room for future growth and feature additions.

```
Let's create the C4 diagrams for LIT-ATS-JACA, considering the given tech stack, system architecture, and "Must Have" priorities.

```

These C4 diagrams provide a comprehensive view of the LTI-ATS-JACA system at different levels of abstraction:

1. The Context Diagram shows the system's interactions with users and external systems.
2. The Container Diagram breaks down the system into its main components and shows their interactions.
3. The Component Diagram focuses on the Application Server, showing its internal components and their relationships.

These diagrams align with the given tech stack, system architecture, and "Must Have" priorities, providing a clear visualization of the system's structure and interactions.

```
Let's create the C4 Code diagrams for the following components:

- Job Controller
- Application Controller
- Interview Controller
- User Controller

Description of the Architecture:

1. Client: The frontend is built using React.js with TypeScript, providing a responsive and type-safe user interface.

2. API Gateway: Kong serves as the API gateway, handling incoming requests, routing them to appropriate microservices, and managing cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and authentication.

3. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JWT is used for secure authentication and authorization across the system.

4. Microservices: The backend is divided into four main microservices:
   - Job Service: Manages job postings and related operations.
   - Application Service: Handles job applications and candidate information.
   - Interview Service: Manages interview scheduling and feedback.
   - User Service: Handles user management and authentication.

   Each microservice is built using Node.js with Express.js.

5. Message Queue: RabbitMQ is used for asynchronous communication between microservices, enabling event-driven architecture and improving system resilience.

6. Database: PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for storing structured data across all microservices.

7. Caching: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

8. Search Engine: Elasticsearch provides powerful full-text search capabilities, particularly useful for job and candidate searches.

9. Monitoring & Logging:
   - Prometheus collects metrics from all services.
   - Grafana visualizes the metrics collected by Prometheus.
   - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for centralized logging and log analysis.

10. CI/CD: GitHub Actions automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

11. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

12. Cloud Provider: The entire infrastructure is hosted on AWS, leveraging its scalable and reliable cloud services.

This architecture follows microservices best practices:

- Loose coupling: Each service operates independently and communicates via well-defined APIs.
- Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- Resilience: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system.
- Technology diversity: Each service can potentially use different technologies if needed.
- Continuous deployment: Services can be deployed independently, enabling faster iterations.

The use of Kubernetes for container orchestration allows for efficient management of the microservices, while the API Gateway provides a single entry point for clients, simplifying the client-side code and providing a unified interface for the microservices.

Monitoring, logging, and CI/CD are integral parts of the architecture, ensuring the system's health, performance, and rapid, reliable deployments.

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the LTI-ATS-JACA applicant tracking system.

```
Each micro-service should have its own database, reflect that in the diagram.
```

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the oversight. In a true microservices architecture, each service should indeed have its own database. I'll update the diagram to reflect this important aspect. Here's the revised architecture diagram:

```mermaid

```

Description of the updated architecture:

The main change in this updated diagram is that each microservice now has its own dedicated database:

1. Job Service: Connected to Job DB
2. Application Service: Connected to Application DB
3. Interview Service: Connected to Interview DB
4. User Service: Connected to User DB

All these databases are represented as separate entities (D1, E1, F1, G1) within their respective microservice subgraphs.

This design adheres more closely to microservices principles:

1. Database per Service: Each microservice has its own private database, ensuring loose coupling and independent scalability.

2. Data Autonomy: Each service has complete control over its data model and schema, allowing for independent evolution.

3. Polyglot Persistence: While we're using PostgreSQL across the board in this case, the architecture now allows for different database technologies per service if needed in the future.

4. Scalability: Each database can be scaled independently based on the specific needs of its service.

5. Fault Isolation: Issues with one database don't directly impact other services.

The rest of the architecture remains the same:

- The API Gateway (Kong) routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
- RabbitMQ facilitates asynchronous communication between services.
- Redis provides caching capabilities across services.
- Elasticsearch offers powerful search functionality.
- Monitoring and logging tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) oversee the entire system.
- GitHub Actions manage the CI/CD pipeline.
- Kubernetes orchestrates the containerized services.
- The entire infrastructure is hosted on AWS.

This revised architecture provides a more accurate representation of a microservices-based system, with each service maintaining its own data store. This approach enhances service independence, allows for better scalability, and provides more flexibility in terms of data management and evolution for each microservice.

Create an Entity Relationship Diagram for the "Must Have" features and following the micro-services architecture planned using Mermaid, following the best practices for UML syntax. Include the field names, field types, primary keys and foreign keys required for each entity following the best practices for RDMS.
```

Certainly! I'll create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the "Must Have" features, following the microservices architecture we've planned. This ERD will be divided into four parts, one for each microservice (Job, Application, Interview, and User). I'll use Mermaid syntax and follow best practices for UML and RDBMS design.

```mermaid

    %% Job Service
    JOB {
        BIGSERIAL job_id PK

        TEXT description

        BIGINT created_by_user_id FK

    }

    %% Application Service

    }

    %% Interview Service
    INTERVIEW {

        BIGINT application_id FK
        BIGINT interviewer_id FK
        TIMESTAMP scheduled_at
        VARCHAR(50) status
        TEXT feedback
    }

    %% User Service
    USER {
        BIGSERIAL user_id PK
        VARCHAR(100) username
        VARCHAR(255) email
        VARCHAR(255) password_hash
        VARCHAR(50) role
        TIMESTAMP created_at
        TIMESTAMP last_login
    }

    %% Relationships
    JOB ||--o{ JOB_SCREENING_QUESTION : "has"
    JOB ||--o{ APPLICATION : "receives"
    CANDIDATE ||--o{ APPLICATION : "submits"
    CANDIDATE ||--o{ EEO_DATA : "provides"
    APPLICATION ||--o{ INTERVIEW : "schedules"
    USER ||--o{ JOB : "creates"
    USER ||--o{ INTERVIEW : "conducts"
```

Description of the ERD:

1. Job Service:
   - JOB: Represents job postings.
   - JOB_SCREENING_QUESTION: Stores screening questions for each job.

2. Application Service:
   - CANDIDATE: Stores information about job applicants.
   - APPLICATION: Represents a candidate's application for a specific job.
   - EEO_DATA: Contains Equal Employment Opportunity data for candidates.

3. Interview Service:
   - INTERVIEW: Stores interview details for applications.

4. User Service:
   - USER: Represents system users (recruiters, hiring managers, admins).

Key points about the design:

1. Primary Keys: Each table has a BIGSERIAL primary key, which auto-increments and ensures each record has a unique identifier.

2. Foreign Keys: Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables, even across different services. In a microservices architecture, these would be logical relations rather than actual foreign key constraints in the database.

3. Data Types: Appropriate PostgreSQL data types are used (e.g., VARCHAR for strings, TEXT for long text, TIMESTAMP for dates and times).

4. Normalization: The design follows normalization principles to reduce data redundancy.

5. Scalability: The use of BIGSERIAL for IDs allows for a large number of records.

6. Audit Fields: Created_at and updated_at fields are included where appropriate for auditing purposes.

7. Status Fields: Enum-like status fields are used to track the state of jobs, applications, and interviews.

Inter-service relationships:
- The JOB table in the Job Service has a foreign key to the USER table in the User Service (created_by_user_id).
- The APPLICATION table in the Application Service has a foreign key to the JOB table in the Job Service.
- The INTERVIEW table in the Interview Service has foreign keys to the APPLICATION table in the Application Service and the USER table in the User Service.

In a true microservices architecture, these cross-service relationships would be managed at the application level rather than through direct database foreign keys. Each service would maintain its own database integrity, and inter-service data consistency would be ensured through careful API design and eventual consistency patterns.

This ERD provides a solid foundation for the "Must Have" features of the LTI-ATS-JACA system, following best practices for both UML and RDBMS design in a microservices context.
