To prioritize the user stories, I used a combination of the following methodologies:

### 1. **MoSCoW Method:**
   - **Must have:** Essential features that are critical for the functioning of the ATS. These are high-priority features that cannot be omitted.
   - **Should have:** Important features that add significant value but are not critical for the initial release.
   - **Could have:** Features that are desirable but not essential. They can be included if time and resources permit.
   - **Won't have:** Features that are out of scope for the current project phase but may be considered for future iterations.

### 2. **Business Value and Effort Estimation:**
   - **Business Value:** Assessed the impact of each feature on the overall recruitment process efficiency and user satisfaction. High business value features are prioritized higher.
   - **Effort Estimation:** Estimated the effort required to implement each feature using story points. Features with higher effort but essential for core functionality were prioritized after careful consideration.

### 3. **Alignment with Business Goals:**
   - Ensured that the features align with LTI’s business goals of digitalizing and automating the recruitment process. Features that significantly contribute to achieving these goals were prioritized higher.

### 4. **User Impact:**
   - Evaluated the direct impact on users (recruiters, hiring managers, candidates). Features that improve user experience and efficiency were given higher priority.

### Prioritization Process:

1. **Identify Core Functionalities:**
   - Job Posting and Distribution
   - Resume Parsing
   - Candidate Management
   - Application Tracking
   - Interview Scheduling
   - Communication Tools
   - Reporting and Analytics
   - Compliance Management

2. **Incorporate AI Capabilities:**
   - AI-Powered Resume Screening
   - AI-Driven Candidate Matching

3. **Evaluate Importance and Effort:**
   - Features essential for the initial release and high business value (e.g., Job Posting, Resume Parsing) were marked as high priority.
   - Features enhancing user experience and efficiency but not critical for the first release were given medium priority (e.g., Interview Scheduling, Reporting and Analytics).

4. **Reassess and Adjust:**
   - Replaced less critical features (e.g., Mobile Access, Collaboration Features) with high-value AI features to ensure the ATS leverages modern technology for enhanced functionality.

This approach ensured a balanced and strategic prioritization of user stories, focusing on delivering maximum value in the initial release while aligning with LTI’s business objectives.

### Tickets/Tasks:

### Sprint Planning and Task Breakdown

Given the 10 working days of 8 hours each day (80 hours per sprint) and the product backlog priorities, we will break down the user stories into tasks, prioritize them, and estimate the time required for each.

### Estimation Method
We'll use **Planning Poker** for story point estimation. For simplicity, we will convert story points to hours using an average conversion factor of 1 story point = 8 hours.

### Sprint Plan
We'll start with a conservative approach, assuming the team's velocity is unknown. We will assume an average of 10 story points per sprint initially and adjust based on the team's performance in future sprints.

### Adjusted Sprint Plan and Task Breakdown with All Resources

### Resource Allocation and Task Estimation

Given the team composition and the need to include tasks for all roles, we'll distribute tasks accordingly and re-estimate the story points per sprint to ensure balanced workload.
